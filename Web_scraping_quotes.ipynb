AI has a vast amount of control already and has started replacing humans in multiple spheres of life, however, it is also making jobs easier for us and is allowing us to spend more time doing what we love. Regardless of how beneficial advanced AI is, there is always the fear of AI going out of control or becoming too powerful for us to do anything about it. There might be a point in the future where we just have to watch AI take over with our hands tied behind our backs.
